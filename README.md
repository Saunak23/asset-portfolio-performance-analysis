1. Compared portfolio returns across asset classes often led to misleading conclusions due to differences in volatility and market exposure.

2. Designed a portfolio analysis framework that accurately reflected risk-adjusted investor outcomes, not just absolute returns.

3. Optimised portfolios using Sharpe Ratio, Treynor Ratio, and Jensen’s Alpha, allowing me to evaluate performance relative to total risk, systematic risk, and CAPM expectations. I also assessed directional accuracy to understand consistency in return behaviour.

4. The framework enabled more informed asset allocation decisions by identifying portfolios that delivered superior returns per unit of risk, aligning closely with wealth management objectives.
